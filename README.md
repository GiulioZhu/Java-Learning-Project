# Java-Learning-Project #
 
This project includes 3 projects I've worked over years:
- Grades (2019-2020, needs to be optimized an incorporate Object-Oriented Programming)
- Number (2019-2020)
- Bank Simulator Project (2021-2022, paused, need to incorporate database with 'mySQL')
- Hotel Management Simulator (2022-now), in-progress, its completion depends on my willingness.

This project can be found in my GitHub account at :https://github.com/GiulioZhu/Java-Learning-Project.git
