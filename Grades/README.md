# Grades Project
This project contain 2 main files:
- 'GPA.java'
- 'ClassGrade.java'
 
## WHAT DOES 'GPA PROJECT' DO?
It first prompts the user the number of classes he takes (precondition: only numbers NO characters or words), then it will ask for the grades for each class (precondition: numbers from 0-100, postocondition: it continues to ask for class grades until the user enters the grade for all the classes he takes).
Then, the program asks the user if he wants to know his own GPA (precondition: ONLY numbers '1' for Yes or '2' for No; NO characters or words, postcondition: depending on the user's answer the program will reveal the GPA of the user based on the class grades)

## WHAT DOES 'ClassGrade PROJECT' DO?
It first prompts the user the number of categories based on which the class grade is determined (i.e. Test, Homework, Quiz) (precondition: ONLY numbers NO characters or words). Then, the program prompts the user to insert the name of the Category (i.e. Test, Homework, Quiz), how many grades and the grades he got on that category (for instance, the student will report ALL the test scores for Test category or quiz scores for Quiz category), and the percentage (weighting) of that category in the overall class grade.
After inserting all the required information, the program will ask the user if he wants to know his own class grade (precondition: ONLY numbers '1' for Yes or '0' for No; NO characters or words, postcondition: depending on the user's answer the program will reveal the class grade and the average grade in each category).

## BACKGROUND INFO
- For reference, I just applied the concept of ArrayList that I learned from 'W3School' into the my program.

### Note To Execute The Program: 
In order to execute the program all the files must be compiled through Terminal/Command line through 'javac [name of the file.java]' for the two files ('GPA.java', and 'ClassGrade.java'). Consequently, just run the files with 'java GPA.java' and 'java ClassGrade.java'. (Note: this is just what I normally do to execute the files)
