# Numbers Project

## WHAT DOES THIS PROJECT DO?
It will prompt the user to enter a number (precondition: ANY number; NO characters or words, postcondition: the program will determine if the inserted number is postive/negative, integer/decimal, and if it's divisible by a prime number).

## Additional Comments
This program is extremely limited as it can ONLY determine if a number is divisible by a prime number smaller than 100. Additionally, all the numbers are stored in a array, which is also extremely limited since the numbers are infinite. As a programmer, I should develop an algorithm to automatically create and store prime numbers, which then allows me to automatically detect if a number is divisible by any prime number.

### Note To Execute The Program: 
In order to execute the program all the files must be compiled through Terminal/Command line through 'javac [name of the file.java]' for the file 'Number.java'. Consequently, just run the 'Number.java' file with 'java Main.java'. (Note: this is just what I normally do to execute the files)
