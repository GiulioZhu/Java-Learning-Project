## CONSUMER REVIEW LAB
# Overview
## Introduction
### Description

The Consumer Review Lab provides students with the opportunity to work on a larger
assignment involving multiple classes early in the course, before they necessarily
know how to write their own classes. By focusing on calling methods and using the
control structures of selection and iteration, students will have practice that directly
relates to the “Methods and Control Structures” free-response question type that
they will see on the end-of-year exam. Because students often struggle with methods
in the String class, this lab specifically focuses on calling these methods and
building strings in an engaging and interesting way.

### Real-World Connection
We all use reviews on a regular basis, to help us determine which movie to see, which
video game to play, or even which pair of headphones to buy. But how easy is it to fake
a review? The truth is that it‘s incredibly simple, and fake reviews can have significant
impacts on the products that are purchased or consumed, including movies that
people watch and restaurants where they choose to eat. If consumers knew that the
review they were reading and using to base a decision on came from a computer
program and not a human, they might be less likely to believe it.
What motivation do people have for creating these fake reviews or comments, and
what should be done to prevent it, if anything? If technology can be used to create
and post positive reviews for the company‘s own products or negative reviews of the
competition, what are the ethical implications of this?
Creating fake reviews has ethical implications, and it is important to emphasize that
although students are going through the process to see one way in which they can
be generated, this is in no way advocating this type of behavior. This is similar to
“white hat” hackers needing to understand the same tools and processes of criminal
hackers in order to do their job. Discuss with students the ethical concerns and how
understanding this process is important to preventing unwanted behaviors online.

### Suggested Reading
Although it is not assessed, this course covers the ethical and social implications
of computing systems. While this topic does not appear in the unit guide until Unit
5, this lab provides a real-world premise to begin this discussion. As a pre-reading
assignment or as an extension after completing the lab, have students read an article
on fake reviews. Do a search for “Fake Reviews” to get a list of recent news articles
related to the ethical and social implications of fake reviews.
